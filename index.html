    <h2>About Mishin</h2>
    <p>
      I started Mishin after working in Human Resources for 8 years. As a graduate of Miranda House and an MBA in HR from IMT Ghaziabad, I’ve always believed that real learning comes from experience. Throughout my journey in various industries and cultures, I realized the impact of process-driven hiring and candidate experience. Mishin—rooted in my surname, Mishra, and inspired by the word “mission”—was born out of that clarity. Today, we help businesses transform their HR by bringing thoughtful, customized, and effective people practices to life.
